                <p>Dinamulag Mango Festival comes from dinamulag, which is a word in Sambali that means carabao. It refers to the variety of the sweet fruit called carabao mango (mangifera indica L.) that is cultivated in Zambales. Organized by the Zambales Mango Producers Federation (ZAMPROFED) and provincial government in coordination with public and private institutions, the fest was conceptualized as thanksgiving celebration for the harvest of the fruit, promote Zambales mango, and boost tourism.</p>

                <p>January 23 to 24 is the Feast of Ina Poon Bato. There will be flocks of pilgrims from all over the country visiting the Shrine to worship Apo Apang. After pitching candles and offering prayers inside the shrine, we had our lunch in the parking area. We took some pictures too, then we continued our Visita Iglesia to the remaining churches in towns up north.</p>
