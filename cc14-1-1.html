            <h2>Welcome to the Province of Zambales</h2>
            <p>Zambales is a province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is Iba, which is located in the middle of the province. Zambales borders Pangasinan to the north and northeast, Tarlac to the east, Pampanga to the southeast, Bataan to the south and the South China Sea to the west. With a total land area of 3,830.83 square kilometres (1,479.09 sq mi) (including the independent city of Olongapo), Zambales is the second largest among the seven provinces of Central Luzon after Nueva Ecija.</p>

                <p>Silanguin Cove is the farthest of all the newly rediscovered secluded beaches in San Antonio, Zambales. While Nagsasa and Anawangin Coves are littered with volcanic ash, Silanguin is strewn with light grey sand. It isnâ€™t as fair as the others, but the surrounding landscape makes up for it. Silanguin is enclosed by reddish mountains, a surreal backdrop. It is also blessed with shallower waters and friendlier waves, making swimming a lot more enjoyable.</p>

                <p>Anawangin is a cove with a white sand beach framed by a number of low hills not too far from the shore. What sets Anawangin and its sister coves in San Antonio apart from most beaches in the Philippine are the evergreen trees lining the greater length of the beach. Known locally as agoho trees, they are often mistaken for pine trees because of the similarities. There was hardly a coconut tree in this area. A creek winds its way just at the back of the sandy beach, separating yet another forest of evergreens from the former and eventually emptying into the sea. This little forest of evergreen trees has become a favorite camping ground for visitors, including trekkers who travel by land from Pundaquit. In his second visit to Anawangin in 2010, Leo observed that a footbridge had been constructed to enable people from the beach to cross the creek and get to the forest. However the creek itself is shallow and fordable especially during summer.

                <p>Potipot island in Uacon, Candelaria, Zambales had been around our travel radar for years but we had never seriously considered going there until recently. On a drive home through Zambales from Tondol Beach in Anda, Pangasinan last year we encountered people on the highway with signs advertising boat trips to Potipot. We decided we wouldn't allow this year to pass without paying a visit. Our original plan was to visit the island as part of a return trip to Dasol in Pangasinan but we ended up visiting Potipot on a one-day trip instead.</p>
